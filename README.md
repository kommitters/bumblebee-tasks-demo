# **Bumblebee Tasks Demo**

Welcome to the Bumblebee Task Examples repository! This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of examples showcasing the various types of tasks that can be developed using the Bumblebee library.

### **About Bumblebee**

**Bumblebee** **is a** versatile library that offers a wide range of features for building and utilizing **pre-trained machine-learning Axon models**. Additionally, Bumblebee offers configurable Axon models, which serve as high-level interfaces for creating neural network models.

One of the key benefits of Bumblebee is its seamless integration with the Hugging Face Hub. This feature allows users to easily download and perform machine learning tasks on a variety of models. All Neural Networks models can be compiled to the CPU/GPU, thanks to projects such as [EXLA](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/exla) (based on Google XLA) and [Torchx](https://github.com/elixir-nx/nx/tree/main/torchx) (based on Libtorch).
